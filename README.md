# How it works?
This code based on 2 repositories. [Generating](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2) pictures and [upscaling](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler) pictures. I collect code from them and add simple UI. So now you can launch and generate some own your picture.
      
# How to launch?
Download _main.py_ and open console on folder where you save it.                
Than enter:           
```> python3 main.py```       
Program will launch and after first download you can start enjoying process
