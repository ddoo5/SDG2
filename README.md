# How it works? ℹ️
This code based on 2 repositories. [Generating](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2) pictures and [upscaling](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler) pictures. I collect code from them and add simple UI. So now you can launch and generate some own your picture. I recomend to visit [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion) page to get more info about stable diffusion.
      
# How to launch? 🛠️
Download [_main.py_](https://github.com/ddoo5/SDG2/blob/main/main.py)(for stable diffusion v.2) or [_sdg1-4.py_](https://github.com/ddoo5/SDG2/blob/main/sdg1-4.py)(for stable diffusion v.1.4) and open console on folder where you save it.

**Remember** you need installed [python3](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) and [pip](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-pip-on-windows/) or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) to install packages.

Than enter:           
```bash
> python3 main.py
```       
or       
```bash
> python3 sdg1-4.py
```
Program will launch and you will see simple UI. 

```bash
Do u want to generate image? y/n
> y
```

After first download you can start enjoying process.
